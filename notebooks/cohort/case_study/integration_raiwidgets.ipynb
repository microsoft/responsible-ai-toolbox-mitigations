    "# Moving Cohorts from raimitigations to raiwidgets (and vice versa)\n",
    "\n",
    "[raiwidgets](https://github.com/microsoft/responsible-ai-toolbox) is a library that offers several visualization tools for comparing models, and among these tools, it offer ways to compare the results between different cohorts. The ``raiwidgets`` library has their own way of defining a cohort, but ``raiwidgets`` and ``raimitigations`` both use the same standard for saving the definitions of a cohort into a JSON file. This makes it easier for users to go back and forth these two libraries when working with cohorts. The adoption of a unified JSON interface supports the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A user starts by doing some analysis and applying mitigations using the ``raimitigations`` library over different cohorts (using the [CohortManager](../cohort_manager.ipynb) class). They then save their cohorts using the ``CohortManager.save_cohorts()`` method, which will create a JSON file for each of the existing cohorts. Finally, the user can use those JSON files to recreate those cohorts in the ``raiwidgets`` library and continue with their analysis using that library;\n",
    "2. A user starts by creating a set of cohorts in the ``raiwidgets`` library, where they perform some analysis. They then save those cohorts into a set of JSON files, which are then loaded using the ``CohortManager`` class. From here, users can apply a set of mitigations over each cohort.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to demonstrate how to achieve these two scenarios. For this, we'll be using the Adult Census Dataset. First of all, make sure that ``raiwidgets`` is installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "> pip install raiwidgets\n",
