    "# Cohort Case Study 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first case study for the ``cohort`` submodule, we'll create a synthetic dataset that has some characteristics that will highlight the advantages of using pre-processing pipelines for each cohort separately instead of using it over the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adopting a separate pipeline for each cohort is not an approach that will work in every situation. In fact, it is usually recommended to process the entire dataset instead of analyzing each cohort separately. But in some cases, certain cohorts behave differently from others, and the intensity of this difference will indicate if using a cohort-based pipeline is the best approach or not. When each cohort has a distinct behavior, *e.g.*, considerably different class distributions, different feature importance, opposite class behaviors, different value distribution for certain features, etc., then one cohort might end up degrading the performance of a model trained over the entire dataset when evaluated over the remaining cohorts. This is especially true when we have cohorts with very different behaviors, and one cohort that comprises the majority of the instances: in this case, the model trained over the entire dataset might simply learn how to predict the class of the instances of this majority cohort, and simply ignore the other cohorts. By doing this, the model will still achieve good results, but at the cost of neglecting the minority cohorts. This becomes a major concern when we are dealing with sensitive cohorts, that is, cohorts built with sensitive features, such as (but not limited to): gender, nationality, race, age, or a combination of these features. When a model performs well for one of the sensitive cohorts, but under-performs for the remaining cohorts, then the model is considered to be biased and may result in several legal problems. To mitigate these discrepancies, we might need to apply different pre-processing operations over each cohort separately, or even train different models for each cohort. \n",

    "## Creating the artificial dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that scenarios that benefit from using different data pipelines for each cohort are not common, in this first case study we'll use a synthetic dataset that is created to artificially create this scenario. Here are the main characteristics that we want to see in our dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Different cohorts and sub-cohorts that behave differently:** to simulate this, we can use different rules to establish each instance's class based on which cohort it belongs to. By doing this, a model will have a hard time understanding the general classification rule if trained with the entire dataset, since learning how to classify instances from one cohort may harm the classification capabilities for another cohort;\n",
    "2. **Different value ranges and distributions for numerical features:** if the values for a feature vary considerably for different cohorts, we may find it useful to normalize these features separately for each cohort, instead of normalizing it for the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset will detail if a company went bankrupt (after a fixed number of months) or not. The only features used for each company are: the company's country's of origin, the industry sector to which it belongs, and the initial investment poured into the creation of the company measured in the company's country local currency. Each country has different local currency values, so it is expected that this feature varies based on the country's value. Also, due to each country's many characteristics (culture, environment, financial situation, social differences, etc.), each industry sector functions differently based on the country of the company. For example, a company that sells tropical fruits requires a lot less investment to succeed in tropical countries when compared to countries farther away from tropical areas. Finally, the rule adopted to define the class of each company (1 if the company went bankrupt, and 0 otherwise) is the following: if  the investment value is larger than a given threshold then the company succeeded (class 0). For some companies, however, this behavior is inverted: if the investment is larger than the threshold, the company goes bankrupt. This threshold is defined for each sector in each country.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also add some noise to the dataset by adding some missing values in the ``investment`` column, as well as inverting a small percentage of the final classes."

We'll create a pipeline with an imputer, a data normalization transformer, a one-hot encoding transformer, and finally our simple estimator. We'll then test our pipeline over the test set and analyze how this pipeline performs over different cohorts. This analysis is done using the ``fetch_cohort_results`` function, which shows the results obtained for the entire dataset, as well as for different cohorts. Notice that this function computes all metrics for each cohort separately, and therefore, different thresholds might be encountered for each cohort (the optimal threshold of a given set of predictions is found using the ROC curve). For now, we'll focus on the cohorts defined by the different countries in the dataset."

However, since we have only a single estimator, we should consider only a single threshold for the entire dataset (the threshold referenced here is the threshold used to determine if a probability should be considered from class ``1`` or class ``0``). The function ``fetch_cohort_results()`` analyzes the results separately for each cohort, that is, all metrics are computed using the isolated predictions of each cohort. That is why we can see that each cohort used different thresholds (``threshold`` column). But if we use the same optimal threshold computed for the entire dataset for all cohorts (which makes sense in this case, since we have a single estimator), then we'll notice that the results are very different."

    "We can see that by comparing the previous results with the one obtained by using the cohort-based pipeline (the one for the cohorts based on the ``sector`` and ``country`` columns) over the original dataset, we can notice that the new rebalanced dataset performed considerably worse. Using the original dataset, we managed to get good metrics for the entire dataset and for each individual cohort. But when we use the rebalanced dataset, the metrics for some cohorts have become severely worse (for example, the metrics for cohort ``cohort_4``). One possible explanation for this is that, given that each cohort behaves very differently from the other, the new instances created by the SMOTE method (used internally by the ``Rebalance`` class) for some cohorts are not very befitting to the behavior analyzed in each cohort. This is especially true in smaller cohorts, that have fewer data points that can be used in the data creation process used in SMOTE. However, this has little impact when we train a pipeline over the full dataset since these small cohorts are already marginalized in these pipelines. But when we train a separate pipeline for each cohort, and we insert noisy data points into small cohorts, this noise has a great impact on the resulting estimator, as we can see from the previous results.\n",

    "We can check this by printing the statistics for the investment column for all cohorts in the original dataset and for the rebalanced dataset. Notice how the value range changes drastically from the original to the rebalanced datasets for several cohorts. The mean and standard deviation also suffers great changes."

    "Suppose now that we are interested in improving the performance over a single cohort, not the entire dataset. For example, let's consider that we are satisfied with the results obtained for all cohorts except for cohort ``cohort_7``. This way, we want to improve the metrics only for this cohort and try to leave the other cohorts as is. To this end, we'll use the ``Rebalance`` class once again, but this time we'll use it inside the ``CohortManager`` class. This way, we'll be able to rebalance only a specific set of cohorts. We'll use an empty list of transformations for all cohorts except for ``cohort_7``, which is the 8th cohort in the list."
