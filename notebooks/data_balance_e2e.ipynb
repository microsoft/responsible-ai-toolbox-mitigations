    "Now that we have a baseline model to work with, we can see how this model is doing overall on the data and see if there are any cohorts within the data that it performs worse on. We use the [Error Analysis Dashboard](https://erroranalysis.ai/) to determine which cohorts of data this model performs worse on. Since the error analysis dashboard is interactive and too large to render on Github, we will include screenshots from our analysis. From these screenshots we can see that if we zoom in on certain cohorts that the model is getting more errors on, that region, department and education are all attributes that are involved in those cohorts. For the purpose of this example, we chose remove some of the other columns like KPIs_met from the error analysis since we want to focus on attributes that may lead to biases rather than more measurable attributes. We will focus on analyzing and mitigating errors within the department and education columns for the rest of the analysis. "

    "First we can take a look at the feature balance measures. These measures indicate the difference in the label column amongst different feature values. For example the first row here indicates if people with the \"Masters & above\" education has a different proportion of people receiving the promoted outcome than those that have a Bachelor's. Lower values of these measures indicates that the amounts of people with class A vs versus those with class B with a label of 1 is similar."

    "### Error Mitigation: Rebalancing dataset\n",
    "In order to rebalance the data we can choose from three different methods of under or oversampling. These are SMOTE, Tomek and SMOTE-Tomek. SMOTE is a oversampling technique for the less represented class. Tomek is an undersampling technique that would be applied to the more represented class. Smote-Tomek is when both of these methods are applied in conjunction on the dataset. In this example, we will choose to use the SMOTE sampling technique on the columns of interest. The Rebalance function can only be applied on one column at a time so in order to apply this rebalancing technique on a cohort of two sensitive columns instead of an individual column, we combine these two columns into a single column that can be balanced.

We compare the results below and find that the new model trained on the data post rebalancing does a better job predicting true positives than the original model and thus has greater recall and overall precision. So not only does data rebalancing help with making sure a model is less biased, it also helps the model actually fit and be able to predict the data outcomes more accurately. "
