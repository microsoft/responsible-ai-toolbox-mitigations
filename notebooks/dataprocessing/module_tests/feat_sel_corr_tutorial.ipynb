    "# Checking Correlations Between Variables - A Comprehensive Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was created to show how several use cases for the **CorrelatedFeatures** class. This class computes several correlation metrics for different types of correlations:\n",
    "* Numerical x Numerical;\n",
    "* Numerical x Categorical;\n",
    "* Categorical x Categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute these correlations, it is necessary to call the .fit() method first. This method will be responsible for computing the different correlations metrics, which depend on the data type of each variable. After all computations (which may take a while depending on the correlation metrics chosen and the dataset size), three JSON files containing different summaries will be saved. The user can then open these JSON files and look into all correlation metrics by themselves, allowing them to use their domain knowledge to determine the best variables to be removed.\n",

    "## 1 - Toy Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we need a dataset with several correlated variables. Ideally, we need a dataset with pairs of numerical, numerical and categorical, and categorical correlated variables to test all this class has to offer. Since we don't have such dataset at our disposal, we will create an artificial dataset with the desired characteristics. We will create a dataset with **samples** data points and **n_features** base features, where:\n",
    "* **n_num_num** new numerical features are created, where each new feature copies one of the **n_features** existing numerical features and then adds a noise over these original values. The standard deviation used for generating the noise is a random value between **num_num_noise[0]** and **num_num_noise[1]**. If the degree of the correlation between the two features depends on the standard deviation used for generating the noise;\n",
    "* **n_cat_num** new categorical features are created, where these new features are correlated to the existing numerical features in the dataset. The ith new categorical feature created will be correlated to the ith existing numerical feature of the dataset df. To force this correlation, the numerical feature will be categorized by creating bins, where the number of bins varies between 2 to 10. Each bin is associated with a categorical value. After that, we change a fraction of **p** bins by swapping the categorical value of some bins. Here, **p** is a value in the range [0,1] that is chosen to be between **pct_change[0]** and **pct_change[1]**. If the numerical feature selected is already correlated to another numerical feature, the new categorical feature could also be correlated to this second numerical feature.;\n",
    "* **n_cat_cat** new categorical features are created in a way similarly to the previous **n_cat_num** features. The ith new categorical feature here is created following the same logic explained above, and it is also correlated to the ith numerical feature of the dataset. This way, the ith categorical feature created between the **n_cat_cat** features will be correlated to the ith categorical feature created between the **n_cat_num** features, since both are correlated to the same numerical feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an inherent randomness associated with the creation process of this dataset. We can control the strength of these correlations by tuning the **num_num_noise** and **pct_change** parameters: lower values for both of these parameters results in variables with a higher correlation. "

    "\n",
    "Let's consider the following scenario: a beginner data scientist wants to check for correlations within a dataset. But this data scientist doesn't really understand how these correlations are measured, nor how to interpret them. Actually, this data scientist doesn't even care for these details: its goal is to simply remove a set of features that are already explained well enough within other features, that is, the data scientist just wants to remove one feature for each pair of correlated features and reduce the overall number of features used in its training pipeline (if possible). This means that the data scientist isn't interested in analyzing the JSON summary generated by the **CorrelatedFeatures** class: the goal is to simply remove a set of features that are correlated to other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **CorrelatedFeatures** class was designed to perform all of these desired steps automatically. If the user doesn't really understand what each parameter means, we set these parameters with default values capable of delivering reasonable results on the average case (depends on the dataset used). The only thing required is that the user instantiates the class (leave all parameters blank, that is, using their default values), call the fit method using their dataset, and then use the transform method to remove the unwanted columns of a second dataset (this second dataset could be the same used for the fit method or another dataset that has the same structure). The following code executes all of these steps."

    "## 4 - A Pro User's View of the CorrelatedFeatures class\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now consider the scenario where a pro data scientist wants to use the **CorrelatedFeatures** class to compute different correlation metrics. In contrast to the previous scenarios, this user doesn't want to rely on the class to automatically select the best features. Instead, the user wants to access all correlation metrics computed, even those for pairs of variables defined as not correlated. To this end, the user can use the **get_summary** method, which returns 3 JSON files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Full Summary**: when calling the fit method, all correlations will be computed according to the many parameters detailed previously. After computing all these data, everything is saved in a JSON file, which can then be accessed and analyzed carefully. We recommend using a JSON viewing tool for this. This JSON is saved in the file specified by the parameter **json_summary**;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Correlated JSON**: similar to the full summary, but stores only information of pairs of correlated variables (with no repetitions). This JSON is saved in the file specified by the parameter **json_corr**;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Uncorrelated JSON**: similar to the full summary, but stores only information of pairs of uncorrelated variables (with no repetitions). This JSON is saved in the file specified by the parameter **json_uncorr**;\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the user will use the \"model\" method for computing the correlations between numerical and categorical variables. For each pair of numerical and categorical variables, this approach does the following: trains a simple decision tree using the numerical variable and predicts the categorical variable. Both variables are first divided into a training and test set (70% and 30% of the size of the original variables, respectively). The training set is used to train the decision tree, where the only feature used by the model is the numerical variable and the predicted label are the different values within the categorical variable. After trained, the model is to predict the values of the test set and a set of metrics are computed to assess the performance of the model (the metrics computed are defined by the **model_metrics** parameter). If all metrics computed are above the threshold defined by the **metric_th** parameter, then both variables are considered to be correlated. Here, we will use F1 and Accuracy as the evaluation metrics, both with a threshold of 0.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the user wants to save the resulting JSON files in the folder \"./corr_json_examples\". To do this, we use the *json_summary*, *json_corr*, and *json_uncorr* parameters to specify the path to the json files."

In the following image, we can see an example for a numerical x numerical correlation type, where we used all three numerical correlation metrics: Spearman, Pearson, and Kendall.

    "### Using the Jensen-Shannon approach for numerical x categorical correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cell shows how to use the Jensen-Shannon approach for numerical x categorical correlations. For a given pair A, B, where A is a numerical feature and B is a categorical feature, this approach does the following: first we cluster the numerical values of A according to their respective values of the categorical data B. We then compute the probability density function of the numerical variable for each cluster (we approximate the PDF with the histogram using **jensen_n_bins** different bins). The next step is to compute the Jensen-Shannon Distance metric between the distribution functions of each pair of clusters. This distance metric varies from 0 to 1, where values closer to 0 means that both distributions tested are similar and values closer to 1 means that the distributions are different. If all pairs of distributions tested are considered different (a Jensen-Shannon metric above **jensen_th** for all pairs tested), then both variables are considered to be correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we also present another parameter: the **tie_method**. Whenever a pair of variables is considered correlated, we must choose one of them to remove from the dataset. The first priority is to remove the variables with the most number of correlations. After computing all correlations, we build a graph G = (V, E) with a set of vertices V and a set of edges E. We create one vertex for each variable and one edge for each pair of correlated variables. We then compute the degree of all variables. The next step is to analyze each edge: for each edge, we remove the vertex with the highest degree. If both vertices have the same degree, then we use a tie method, which can be the following:\n",
    "* \"missing\": chooses the variable with the least number of missing values;\n",
    "* \"var\": chooses the variable with the largest data dispersion (std / (V - v), where std is the standard deviation of the variable, V and v are the maximum and minimum values observed in the variable, respectively). Works only for numerical x numerical analysis. Otherwise, it uses the cardinality approach internally;\n",
    "* \"cardinality\":chooses the variable with the most number of different values present;\n",
    "\n",
    "In all three cases, if both variables are tied (same dispersion, same number of missing values, or same cardinality), the variable to be removed will be selected randomly. When we remove a variable, we remove its associated vertex and all of its edges. We then recompute the degree of all variables again, and repeat this process until no edges are left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we also call the **get_summary** method, which returns the full, correlated, and uncorrelated JSONs as a dictionary. This method will also print out all of the information contained in the full summary dictionary. If the user doesn't want this method to print anything, they can just set the **print_summary** parameter to False (it is set to True by default)."

    "### Using the ANOVA test approach for numerical x categorical correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "The other approach implemented for detecting numerical x categorical correlation is the ANOVA test. The following cell shows how to use this method to detect this type of correlation. This method uses the ANOVA test to identify a correlation. First we use the Levene test to see if the numerical variable has a similar variance across the different values of the categorical variable (Homoscedastic data). If the test passes (that is, if the p-value of the Levene test is greater than the value set to the **levene_pvalue** parameter), then we can perform the ANOVA test, in which we compute the F-statistic to see if there is a correlation between the numerical and categorical variables and its associated p-value. We also compute the omega-squared metric. If the p-value is less than the parameter **anova_pvalue** and the omega-squared is greater than the parameter **omega_th**, then both variables are considered to be correlated;"

    "The fit() method executes three different steps:\n",
    "1. **Correlation metrics:** compute the correlation metrics for all pairs of variables;\n",
    "2. **Correlation thresholds:** identify which pairs of variables are correlated by comparing the pair's metrics against the thresholds used (each type of correlation and each method of correlation uses different thresholds);\n",
    "3. **Remove variables:** based on all pairs of correlated variables, choose the variables to be removed using the graph approach in conjunction with the **tie_method** parameter (explained previously).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most computationally expensive operation between these three steps is the **correlation metrics** computation. After these metrics are computed and saved internally (and in the JSON file), we can still test execute steps (2) and (3) without having to recompute all the correlation metrics. To do this, we can use the **update_selected_features()** method, which is a method that allows the user to pass different threshold values and re-select the best features. This is faster than running the fit() method, so we advise using this method instead of fitting the same object several times with different thresholds. Note that the **update_selected_features** only accepts threshold related variables. If the user wishes, for example, to change the correlation method used for numerical x categorical features, so it is necessary to run the fit() method again. But to change the threshold used for the Cramer's V correlation metric, for example, the user can use the **update_selected_features** instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cells we show a use case for this method. First, let's create a new object of the **CorrelatedFeatures** class and fit it for our dataset using a set of thresholds. We'll set the thresholds high for the numerical x numerical correlations and for the numerical x categorical correlations, but we'll set it low for the categorical x categorical correlations. We'll also save the JSON files so we can compare the results later."
