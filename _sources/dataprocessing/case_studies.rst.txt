Case Studies
============

Here is a set of case study scenarios where we use the transformations available in the **dataprocessing**
module in order to train a model for a real-world dataset.


Utilities
---------

All case study notebooks use the functions defined in the **case_study_utils** module. This module is not part of the library, but it was
created to contain certain functionalities used throughout different case studies. The definitions of these functions are given in the following
