Imputers
========

This sub-module of the **dataprocessing** package collects all imputation transformers implemented here.
Imputers are responsible for removing missing values from a dataset by replacing these missing values with
some valid value. The difference between each imputer lies in how these valid values are computed before
being used to replace a missing value.
All the imputer methods from the **dataprocessing** package are based on the abstract class presented below, called
**DataImputer**.

The following is a list of all imputers implemented in this module. All of the classes below inherit from
the **DataImputer** class, and thus, have access to all of the methods previously shown.
