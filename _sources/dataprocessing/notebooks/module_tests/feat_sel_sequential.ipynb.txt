    "The *SeqFeatSelection* implements the Sequential Feature Selection approach using the *mlxtend* library. This method uses an estimator, which is used to test the performance of the model using different sets of features. The default estimator used is a decision tree classifier (DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn). But the user might be interested in using other sklearn estimators to see if they can achieve better results. Therefore, we created the *estimator* parameter, which accepts a sklearn classifier or *None* if the user wants to use the default one. Let's see how we can use the *SeqFeatSelection* subclass while specifying a different classifier. Note that in the following cell we also (i) specify the \"label_col\" using the index of the label column instead of its name (just to show a different approach when specifying this attribute), and (ii) provide the dataset when instantiating the subclass instead of providing it during the fit method."

Otherwise, it is considered a classification task. Note that we can explicitly determine if we want to solve a classification or a regression task by setting the 'regression' parameter when instantiating the **SeqFeatSelection** class: if the 'regression' parameter is set to True, then the task will be considered a regression task, and if set to False, it will be treated as a classification task. The default value of this parameter is None, and in this case, the task will be determined by looking at the data type of the label column, as previously mentioned. If we have a classification problem, but the label column is set with float values (1.0 for class 1, 2.0 for class 2, and so on), then we must set the 'regression' parameter to True."
