Encoders
========

This sub-module of the **dataprocessing** package collects all encoding transformers implemented here.
Encoders are responsible for encoding categorical features into numerical features. All the encoder
methods from the **dataprocessing** package are based on the abstract class presented below, called
**DataEncoding**.

.. autoclass:: dataprocessing.DataEncoding
   :members:
   :show-inheritance:

The following is a list of all encoders implemented in this module. All of the classes below inherit from
the **DataEncoding** class, and thus, have access to all of the methods previously shown.
